# PL_Database
This is a website to help people with the viewing and visualization of football players's statistics.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of these statistics. This is data collected by Opta and presented by https://fbref.com/  

The MongoDB database should now be able to be accessed from any address.

The search bar on the landing page should take you to a player's page when they are selected. However, I am currently not displaying any data yet.

There are tabs in the top right corner that navigate you to other pages on the site.

To get the site running, you would need to run `npm run start` in the prem-data folder, and run `node server` in the server folder.
