This is a website to help people with the viewing and visualization of football players's statistics.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of these statistics. This is data collected by Opta and presented by https://fbref.com/ 

The website's frontend does not display any data as I am working on the backend and making changes to provide users with the best experience on the site. 

The MongoDB database should now be able to be accessed from any address.

The search bar on the landing page should take you to a player's page when they are selected. However, I am currently not displaying any data yet.

There are tabs in the top right corner that navigate you to other pages on the site.
