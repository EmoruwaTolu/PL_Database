This is a website to help people with the viewing and visualization of football players's statistics.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of these statistics. This is data collected by Opta and presented by https://fbref.com/ 

The website's frontend does not display any data as I am working on the backend and making changes to provide users with the best experience on the site. 

I am also currently working on a way to make the database I am using publicly accessible with MongoDB. If that is not possible, I can provide a folder with all the data, and users could create their own MongoDB database with the files.

The search bar on the landing page should take you to a player's page when they are selected. However, I am currently not displaying any data yet.

There are tabs in the top right corner that navigate you to other pages on the site.
